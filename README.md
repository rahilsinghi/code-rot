## 🎯 Purpose

This repository serves as a structured environment for:
- **DSA Practice**: Implementing and understanding core algorithms and data structures
- **Problem Solving**: Solving coding challenges from various platforms
- **Interview Preparation**: Preparing for technical interviews
- **Skill Development**: Improving coding skills across different programming languages
- **Knowledge Documentation**: Maintaining notes and learnings

## 📚 How to Use This Repository

### 1. Problem Solving Workflow
1. Choose a problem from any platform (LeetCode, HackerRank, etc.)
2. Create a new file in the appropriate directory
3. Use the naming convention: `problem-name_difficulty_date.ext`
4. Include problem description, approach, and solution
5. Add time/space complexity analysis

### 2. Learning New Concepts
1. Implement the concept in `data-structures/` or `algorithms/`
2. Add comprehensive comments explaining the logic
3. Include examples and test cases
4. Document learnings in `docs/learning-notes/`

### 3. File Naming Conventions
- **Problems**: `problem-name_easy_2024-01-15.py`
- **Implementations**: `binary-search-tree.py`
- **Notes**: `topic-name-notes.md`

## 🔥 Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.6+ (for automation system)
- Git (for progress tracking)
- Your preferred code editor

### Quick Start
1. **Automated Setup** (Recommended):
   ```bash
   ./setup.sh
   ```
   
   This creates a Python virtual environment with all useful libraries (NumPy, pandas, matplotlib, pytest, etc.) and sets up shell aliases.

2. **Manual Setup**:
   ```bash
   python3 practice.py setup
   ```

3. **Start Your First Practice Session**:
   ```bash
   # Using aliases (after setup.sh)
   pstart --topic arrays --language python
   
   # Or manual command
   source venv/bin/activate && python practice.py start
   ```

4. **Complete and Track Progress**:
   ```bash
   pcomplete --notes "Your approach notes"
   ```

### 🤖 Automation Features
This repository includes a powerful automation system that:
- **Automatically selects problems** based on your preferences
- **Generates solution files** with proper templates
- **Tracks your progress** with detailed statistics
- **Auto-commits to git** with meaningful messages
- **Supports multiple languages** (Python, JavaScript, TypeScript, React)

See [docs/AUTOMATION_GUIDE.md](docs/AUTOMATION_GUIDE.md) for complete documentation.

## 📊 Progress Tracking

### Recommended Tracking Methods
- [ ] Create a progress log in `docs/`
- [ ] Use GitHub issues for problem tracking
- [ ] Maintain a learning journal
- [ ] Set weekly/monthly goals

### Problem Difficulty Distribution
- **Easy**: 40% (Foundation building)
- **Medium**: 45% (Core skill development)
- **Hard**: 15% (Advanced problem solving)

## 🛠️ Best Practices

### Code Quality
- Write clean, readable code
- Add meaningful comments
- Include docstrings/documentation
- Follow language-specific conventions

### Problem Solving Approach
1. **Understand**: Read and analyze the problem thoroughly
2. **Plan**: Think about approach and edge cases
3. **Implement**: Write the solution step by step
4. **Test**: Verify with examples and edge cases
5. **Optimize**: Improve time/space complexity if possible
6. **Document**: Explain your approach and complexity

### Version Control
- Commit frequently with descriptive messages
- Use branches for experimental approaches
- Tag important milestones

## 📖 Learning Resources

### Essential Topics to Cover
- **Data Structures**: Arrays, Linked Lists, Stacks, Queues, Trees, Graphs, Heaps
