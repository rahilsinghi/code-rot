Problem Description:
You are given the heads of two sorted linked lists list1 and list2. Merge the two lists in a one sorted list.

Examples:
Input: list1 = [1,2,4], list2 = [1,3,4]
Output: [1,1,2,3,4,4]

Constraints:
The number of nodes in both lists is in the range [0, 50].
-100 <= Node.val <= 100
Both list1 and list2 are sorted in non-decreasing order.
